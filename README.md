# Pacman x PIET Neon-style Game Display

This p5.js project displays neon-style text inspired by arcade aesthetics.

## 1. How to Interact with the Work
- **Components of the game**
    - _**Interactive Elements**_
    1. Text: "Pacman" and "* PIET" (individual work)
    2. Text: "Click the Screen to start the music" (individual work)
    3. Song: 
    4. The Game Screen (group work)

    - **Non-interactive Elements**
    1. Game console (visual display only)
    2. Joystick and Buttons (purely decorative)
    
- _**Interaction Design**_
    - This project features two modes of interaction: **mouse click** and **sound input.**
    Upon loading the page, users are presented with the instruction:
    ```
    "Click the screen to start the music"
    ```
    Clicking anywhere on the screen triggers background music. Once the music begins, the text elements _"Pacman" and "* PIET"_ respond to the audio input: their brightness and flickering behavior are synchronized with the rhythm and volume of the music. This simulates the dynamic glowing effect of a **retro neon sign.**


## 2. My Individual Approach to Animation
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Make sure `assets/pixelFont.TTF` is correctly placed.
3. No additional setup required.
