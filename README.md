# Pacman x PIET Neon-style Game Display

This p5.js project displays neon-style text inspired by arcade aesthetics.

## 1. How to Interact with the Work
- **Components of the game**
    - **Interactive Elements**
    1. Text: "Pacman" and "* PIET" (individual work)
    2. Text: "Click the Screen to start the music" (individual work)
    3. The Game Screen (group work)

    - **Non-interactive Elements**
    1. Game console (visual display only)
    2. Joystick and Buttons (purely decorative)
    
- **Interaction Design**
    - This project features two modes of interaction: **mouse click** and **sound input.**
    Upon loading the page, users are presented with the instruction:
    ```
    "Click the screen to start the music"
    ```
    Clicking anywhere on the screen triggers background music. Once the music begins, the text elements **"Pacman" and "* PIET"** respond to the audio input: their brightness and flickering behavior are synchronized with the rhythm and volume of the music. This simulates the dynamic glowing effect of a **retro neon sign.**

- Originally interactive with sound, now simplified as a static glowing effect
